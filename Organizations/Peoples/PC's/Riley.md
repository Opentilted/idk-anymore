# <p align="right">Riley Loane</p> 
##### character intro 
- Riley is supposed to be a fun character who is constantly at war with himself.
This is reflected in his literal blood, with the blood of angels running through his veins
while he simultaneously commits himself to debauchery. He feigns being noble and kind
to his mother, yet seeks the lifestyle of adrenaline that taught him how to live. He is a
conflicted character that fights dirty, but desperately wants to do the right thing. His
fighting style is feigning nobility and adventurous ways, but he very quickly drops this
charade (in some cases literally throwing off his cape and hat) to fight flamboyantly and
very dirty, using the environment and enemies against themselves
#####  goals and aspirations 
- Tangible: Find who killed his father and kill him, not for revenge but to prove once
and for all that he is better than his father. 
- Long term: Set his mother up with enough gold for her to live comfortably forever. 
- Intangible: To discover himself and learn to be a better person and suppress the
constant need for dopamine. 
##### Flaws
