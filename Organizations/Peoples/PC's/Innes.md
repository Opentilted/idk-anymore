# <p align="right">Innes</p> 
##### character intro 
- Innes is a reserved, but kind man with an unnatural charm created by his heritage. He seeks to help and heal others but struggles with his own self-hatred and vampiric urges. He strives to follow his deity’s teachings as closely as he can, but fears the day he encounters undead that resemble him more than the mindless zombies he’s dealt with before and worries he won’t be able to go through with his duties. He struggles to be around people besides those he knows well, and generally keeps to himself, but is not averse to socializing, just bad at it.
#####  goals and aspirations 
- Tangible- De-vampire himself for both his devotion to Pharasma, his own fear of himself, and his own safety.
- Intangible- Help people around the continent(including those in mercenary gang), keep Riley safe, follow what his own fate has in store.
##### Flaws 
- Innes is a bit too okay with the idea of death as a cleric of Pharasma, which can lead to a bit of callousness when dealing with those grieving (coupled with being generally bad at socializing 
- He’s a bit close-minded about his beliefs, and finds no fault in Pharasma’s teachings even when to his own detriment 
- Bitey :) (not actually but the urge is there)
